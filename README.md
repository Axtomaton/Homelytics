# About

This application was created to practice webscraping with the Python and the BeautifulSoup4 library, which was used to webscrape houses on the popular 
real estate website, Trulia. I drew inspiration the real estate tech startup, Steignet, which initially started as a platform to consolidate real estate 
for houses in Atlanta, Georgia. Currently, my program is able to seamlessly go through all pages of Trulia, collect all real estate data within any city in 
the world, collect all the real estate datas publically avalaible and filter through all properties that are potentionally below market value ($$).
